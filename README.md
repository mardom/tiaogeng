# Introduction

This is a python package to calculate the ''organized random'' for galaxy clustering measurement based on the idea from [Johnston, et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08467).

To measure the two-point function of galaxy distribution, one needs to calculate so-called random-random and data-random pair counts (see https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993ApJ...412...64L/abstract). However, if the galaxy sample has variable depth due to anisotropic instrument systematics (Galactic extinction, seeing, etc), a uniform random will result in biased estimation of 2PCF. Therefore, one needs to recover the ''organized random'' reflecting the overall selection effect of a synthesis of systematics. In practice, selection functions of systematics could be complicated thus cannot be fit with simple formula. In addition, different systematics might be correlated, which makes the problem more complecated.

The method proposed by [Johnston, et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08467) applies a combination of self-organizing map (SOM) and hierarchical clustering (HC) to capture the clustering on high-dimensional systematics space, and then resample them back to the survey footprint to recover the organized random. This method has been tested on mock galaxy catalog and the KiDS-1000 bright sample.

# Basic idea

The whole idea can be summarized as following:

1. Train a SOM with systematics vectors of the galaxy sample;
2. Group the SOM weight with HC. Each group represents a subsample of galaxies that shares similar systematis and therefore selections;
3. Map galaxies from each hierarchical cluster back to the sky. Galaxies from one cluster occuples disjoint sky regions that shares approximately the same selection function;
4. Resample galaxies randomly in each disjoint region according the galaxy number of corresponding hierarchical cluster;
5. Combine the resampled "galaxies" from all the clusters to get the organized random catalog.

In practice, the organized randoms are reconstructed as a pixelized weight map that quantifies the likelihood that a galaxie will be kept due to systematics selection in each part of the sky. In this package, we use Healpix scheme to pixelize the organised randoms. We also pixelize the galaxy catalog to speed up 2PCF measurement.

# Structure if this package

All the source codes are stored in `./code/src`, including:

- OR_weights.py: the file that contains the class to recover organized random weight;
- treecorr_utils.py: contains a function to call treecorr to calculate 2PCF;
- plot_som.py: contains a function to make fancy SOM plots.

In these files, only `OR_weights.py` is essential, and users are welcome to use their own codes to calculate 2PCF and visualize.

An example notebook is given in `./code/notebooks` which reads a mock catalog generated by the [GLASS](https://glass.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package. Then it adds three types of systematics with simple depletion functions and train a SOM+HC to recover the organized random weight. 2PCF calculated from un-depleted sample + uniform random (unbiased), depleted sample + uniform random (biased), depleted sample + depleted random (true OR), and depleted sample + reconstructed OR (reconstructed OR) are shown as a validation.

# Required packages

Essential: `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `healpy`, [`somoclu`](https://somoclu.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (to train SOM), `sklearn` (to do hierarchical clustering)

Optional (for the example notebook): [`glass`](https://glass.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (note that we use the commit '95fb2bbe27c1597b20b0c9c4b86b7f2dd1237cc9' of glass-dev/glass here. other versions might not work well), [`treecorr`](https://rmjarvis.github.io/TreeCorr/_build/html/index.html), [`pyccl`](https://ccl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

# What is a "tiaogengðŸ¥„"?

Tiaogeng (è°ƒç¾¹) is the Chinese word for "spoon" which is more said in southern China. If we divide tiaogeng into two charactors, "tiao(è°ƒ)" means "to reconcile" and "geng (ç¾¹)" means "Chinese-style thick soup". This is what this code is doing: handling the unevenly observed sky just like to stir your soup to make it taste more smooth and delicious.
